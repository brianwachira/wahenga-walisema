# wahenga-walisema
# An app for adding wise sayings. 
#### By **Brian Wachira**
## Description
This is a vue app to share your wisdom by typing it out as a quote. For a language that I wanted removed from the Kenyan 8.4.4 educational system :smile:, I adopted the name **wahenga walisema**, which is swahili for **elders said** .It depicts experiential wisdom, though experiential wisdom is not always the best :smile:. Some people die from experience.
